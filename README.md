## Welcome to FreeBSD Apache Tomcat!

### What Is It?

Apache Tomcat is open source software developed by the Apache Foundation. Tomcat is written in Java and was first released in 1999. James Duncan Davidson was its original founder, who was working as a software architect at the time. He started developing Apache Tomcat software to provide an implementation for servlets. What are servlets? In simple terms, a servlet is a server technology that helps process http requests and client responses.

Apache and Apache Tomcat are two famous web application servers used all over the world. Apache is a free open source website server that allows users to host and process dynamic websites, while Apache Tomcat is a servlet and JSP container server used to host Java web applications.

Both servers can work together, but their functions and goals are different. Apache is a static server that does not support servlets or JSP, while Apache Tomcat is only used to support Java web applications.

Additionally, Apache handles HTTP requests and Apache Tomcat is used to host Java code such as servlets and JSP. Apache can be used with PHP, Python, and other programming languages, while Apache Tomcat is used exclusively for Java applications.
